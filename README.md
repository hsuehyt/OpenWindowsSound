# OpenWindowsSound

This repository contains a simple batch file that opens the Windows Sound settings window directly, making it easy to access and select a playback device with just a click. This is especially useful when the playback device icon is missing from the bottom-right corner of the desktop or when the device is disabled.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the batch file.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/hsuehyt/OpenWindowsSound.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the folder where the batch file is located.
3. Double-click the `openSoundSettings.bat` file to open the Windows Sound settings window directly.

## Why Use This?

- **Quick Access**: Instead of navigating through multiple menus, you can use this batch file to quickly open the sound settings and select your preferred playback device.
- **Device Missing?**: If the playback device icon is missing from the system tray at the bottom-right corner of your desktop, this batch file will still open the Sound settings, allowing you to select or enable a device.
- **Device Disabled?**: If your device is disabled, you can enable it directly from the Sound settings window after running the batch file.
