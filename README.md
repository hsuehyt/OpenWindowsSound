# OpenWindowsSound

This repository contains a simple batch file and a shortcut that open the Windows Sound settings window directly, making it easy to access and select a playback device with just a click. This is especially useful when the playback device icon is missing from the bottom-right corner of the desktop or when the device is disabled.

## How to Use

### Option 1: Using the Provided Batch File

1. Clone the repository or [download the batch file directly](https://github.com/hsuehyt/OpenWindowsSound/blob/main/OpenWindowsSound.bat).
2. Navigate to the folder where the batch file is located.
3. Double-click the `OpenWindowsSound.bat` file to open the Windows Sound settings window.

### Option 2: Using the Provided Shortcut

1. Clone the repository or [download the shortcut file directly](https://github.com/hsuehyt/OpenWindowsSound/blob/main/Sound.lnk).
2. Navigate to the folder where the shortcut is located.
3. Double-click the `Sound.lnk` file to open the Windows Sound settings window.

This shows the Windows Sound settings that will open when running the batch file or the shortcut.

## Why Use This?

- **Quick Access**: Instead of navigating through multiple menus, you can quickly open the sound settings and select your preferred playback device.
- **Device Missing?**: If the playback device icon is missing from the system tray at the bottom-right corner of your desktop, this shortcut or batch file will still open the Sound settings, allowing you to select or enable a device.
- **Device Disabled?**: If your device is disabled, you can enable it directly from the Sound settings window after running the batch file or using the shortcut.
